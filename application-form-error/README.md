# Hello Adam

Welcome to _Application Form Error_ on the _Ulysses Space Station Clojure Course_.

If you need help running the tests, check out `HELP.md`.

If you get stuck on the exercise, check out `HINTS.md`, but try and solve it without using those first.

If you passed all the tests, check out `SOLUTION.md`, try figuring out how this solution is different than yours.

## Introduction

It seems there's a problem with your application form. Your request on using a different **nick** was denied because you already updated your **nick** to _Adam70_ on _Sol 22, 2070 at 13:10:43.48 Earth UTC_, you can only update it once per decade. I'm not allowed to read any further for privacy reasons, why are you still using paper? Update the form with the right information or I can't give you the W-Tag. It's like a badge but on your wrist. It monitors your health status and it gives you access to the facility. If you lose it you may get stuck in a corridor, or worst.

## Instructions

In this exercise, you'll be updating the `nick` variable. This variable is a string with the real **nick** of the protagonist.

```clojure
nick
;; => "Adam70"
```
