# Hello Adam

Welcome to _Hello Adam_ on the _Ulysses Space Station Clojure Course_.

If you need help running the tests, check out `HELP.md`.

If you get stuck on the exercise, check out `HINTS.md`, but try and solve it without using those first.

If you passed all the tests, check out `SOLUTION.md`, try figuring out how this solution is different than yours.

## Introduction

Hello Adam,

I am doctor Korental the lead researcher in exobiology on the Ulysses Space Station orbiting Earth. I am impressed by your research about the neurons that can't undergo cell division. Please, come visit me, I have something to show you. I reserved for you a seat on the next shuttle. The departure is set in two weeks. A helicopter will pick you up. Do not worry about anything, there is only a small training that lasts a few days. Traveling to space is a lot easier now. Fill the application form I attached here and bring it with you.

Dr. Korental.

## Instructions

In this exercise, you'll be implementing the `send-eip-msg` function that takes a string as argument. This function returns a string that contains the message to send to Dr. Korental.

```clojure
(send-eip-msg "I'm glad about this opportunity, I'll be there.")
;; => "Hello Dr. Korental, I'm glad about this opportunity, I'll be there. Adam."
```
